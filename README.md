This repo contains a completed website that meets all requirements for the project.
-responsive layout Thank God!
-A heap of css
-JS array and return
-JS Carousel
-Git pushed to the max with a few reverts.

Bartender Basics is a compact website that details the rudimentary basis of mixology.

It includes:

  -A responsive Header Element with an attractive background that is imported by css; for functionality.
  
  -A responsive navbar that has css elements for interactivity. Thanks Ben!

 - "Elegant Cocktails" carousel of cocktail examples
 
  operated by j.s using querySelectors, classList, and eventlister that controls with .add & .remove to navigate the .current-slide
  
 - "Recipe Guide" drop down selection of 10 icon cocktail recipes. Thanks Ben again!
 
 which are contained within a select container as option elements which are further catergorized by optgroup.
 
 Note: I would have prefered a better structured output, due to time needed for lesson review that was not possible. Im aware J.S interpolation would be needed.
 
-"Lingo" details 10 key vocabs of bartending

  Which is compound of div elements
  controled by hidden radio buttons which allows display of content when label is checked.
 
 - "Skill" section which detail 4 base techniques that is needed to bartend.
 
 which are contained within div tags flexbox containing 3 seperate elements (.card_title .card img and . card_txt)
 
 I struggled with the flexbox cordination through media queries I adopted it to be presentable.
 
 -  "Tools" shows examples of base bar glasses and a table of pour count.
 
 I used the HTML tabel layout to form the Pour count table
 
 -Finally the footer
  Simple layout with an input for email and a anchor element that directs to the header.
  
 The website is responsive designed by a mobile first approach reponsive up to 1044px at best.
 
 Through this project I found sizing and positioning to be the most challenging. Particullary dealing with flexbox.
 And organization and simplifying my css structures.
 
 However; through this Journey I feel confident from the knowledge I have gained.
 
 Thank you to all the Mentors who have helped.
